# Subway Surf RS 🚇🏃

A Subway Surfers-inspired endless runner game built with Rust and Bevy game engine.

## About

Subway Surf RS is a 3D endless runner game where you control a character running through subway tracks, avoiding obstacles, collecting coins, and dodging trains. Built using the Bevy game engine and Avian physics engine, this project showcases modern Rust game development practices.

## Features

- 🎮 Smooth 3D gameplay with physics-based movement
- 🏃 Character animations and limb movements
- 🚂 Procedurally generated trains and obstacles
- 💰 Coin collection system with score tracking
- 🎯 Dynamic difficulty scaling
- 🎨 Track switching mechanics
- ⚡ Optimized performance with multi-threaded ECS architecture

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version recommended)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

## Building

### Debug Build

```bash
cargo build
```

### Release Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Running

### Run in Debug Mode

```bash
cargo run
```

### Run in Release Mode

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys / WASD**: Move left/right
- **Space / Up Arrow**: Jump
- **Down Arrow**: Slide
- **R**: Restart (when game over)
